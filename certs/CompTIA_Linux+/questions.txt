Which init system is covered by a copyright license agreement that contributors must sign in order to have their contributions included upstream?
          a) Systemd
          b) SysVinit
          c) Init
          d) Upstart

Explanation:
This is a bone of contention as it is not considered to be in the spirit in which the Linux community wants to work. Upstart is covered by a copyright license agreement that contributors must sign if they want their contributions included upstream. Many Debian developers are unwilling to sign such an agreement, in part because of the asymmetry of the agreement in question. They also object to core packages being covered by such terms that they will not contribute under. Upstart was introduced in 2006 with the release of Ubuntu 6.1. At the time Upstart replaced, on some systems, SysVinit which in its turn was considered an upgrade of init.
